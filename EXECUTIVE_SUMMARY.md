## 2. Customer Insights

### Customer Segmentation Analysis

Our analysis identified three distinct customer segments:

| Segment      | % of Base | Avg Orders   | Est. LTV     | Characteristic                          |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |

- Missed cross-sell and upsell opportunities

**Root Causes (Hypothesis):**

1. Lack of post-purchase engagement
2. No loyalty or rewards program
3. Limited remarketing to first-time buyers
4. High competitive pressure in Brazilian e-commerce
